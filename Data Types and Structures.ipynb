A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program."],"metadata":{"id":"gilPke2ibdQL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2 . Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples ?\n","\n","Ans . The dictionary meaning of mutable is \"liable to change\". In simple terms, the object that can be modified is mutable, and the object that can't be modified is immutable.\n","\n","In Python, whenever an object is initiated, a unique ID is assigned to it, which can't be changed, and every object has a type (for example, int, null, float, string, list, etc.) that is also fixed, but the value of an object can either change or not. If the value of an object can be changed, then it is a mutable object. Otherwise, it is immutable."],"metadata":{"id":"Rtjk2-GocF_H"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python ?\n","\n","Ans . The key difference between tuples and lists is that while tuples are immutable objects, lists are mutable. This means tuples cannot be changed while lists can be modified.

Hash tables are designed for efficient data retrieval, allowing you to access a value in constant time (on average) regardless of the size of the data set."],"metadata":{"id":"y6RrTjRSfnWn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.Can lists contain different data types in Python ?\n","\n","Ans.

Performance: Immutable objects can be optimized for memory usage and performance. Python can store strings efficiently because it knows their contents won't change.\n","2. Security: Immutability prevents accidental modifications, which can lead to hard-to-debug errors. This is particularly important in multi-threaded environments where multiple threads might be accessing the same string.\n","3. Hashing: Immutable objects can be easily hashed, which makes them suitable for use as keys in dictionaries. Hashing algorithms rely on the object's contents not changing.\n","4.

This makes them suitable for representing fixed collections of items where you want to ensure that the data remains constant. For example, using a tuple to represent coordinates (x, y) ensures that these values cannot be altered accidentally.\n","Performance: Tuples can be more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations since they have a smaller memory overhead due to their immutability. If you need a collection of items that doesn’t change, using a tuple can lead to better performance.\n","Hashability: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because they are hashable (as long as their elements are hashable). Lists, on the other hand, cannot be used in these contexts due to their mutability.."],"metadata":{"id":"xCJeyr00uZbp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?\n","\n","Ans.Sets in Python are designed to store unique values.
