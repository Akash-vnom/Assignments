What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n","Ans. In programming, abstraction and encapsulation are both techniques that help keep code organized and separate unrelated items.

The subclass can extend the functionality of the superclass by adding new features or overriding existing ones.\n","Benefits\n","Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes relationships between classes. It makes programming simpler and cleaner because you don't have to write the same code again for the new class."],"metadata":{"id":"DGK7YiZ-1c2c"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7.What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n","Ans.Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Here's how it works:\n","Access Modifiers:\n","Public:\n","Members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. By default, all members in Python are public.\n","Protected:\n","Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.

They are denoted by a double underscore (__) prefix."],"metadata":{"id":"qvt6I6al12rG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","Ans.In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.\n","Key points:\n","Method name: The constructor method is named __init__().\n","Purpose: It initializes the object's state by assigning values to its data members.\n","Automatic invocation: The constructor is called automatically when you create an object using the class.\n","self parameter: The first parameter of the constructor is always self, which refers to the instance of the class being created."],"metadata":{"id":"Sjv9FpYP2FwC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n","Ans.The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance.\n","\n","A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can’t access or modify the class state.

Class variables are useful for sharing data between all instances of a class, such as keeping track of the number of instances created or storing a constant value.\n","Instance variables\n","Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.
